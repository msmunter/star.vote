		At the time you cast your vote, you will be asked to upload two supporting documents:
		<ul>
			<li>A government-issued photo ID, such as a driver's license, a passport, or an ID card from any state.</li>
			<li>A recent photo with a clear view of your face that we can match to the face on your photo ID.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		NOTE: For most people it is easiest to upload photos of your documents and vote using a smartphone, but you can also use a computer. If you are unable to upload the documents listed above, please see the note at the bottom of this email for more options.
	</p>
	<p>
		NOTES ON ADDITIONAL VOTER IDENTITY DOCUMENTATION:
		If you do not have a valid photo ID or canâ€™t upload a recent photo of yourself, you can still vote, but your ballot will be considered provisional pending verification.
		To vote with a provisional ballot please submit the following documentation when you cast your ballot:
		<ul>
			<li>Any photo ID which includes your date of birth. (This does not need to be government-issued or from Oregon.)</li>
			<li>Another document confirming the address where you are currently registered to vote and your full name as spelled in your voter registration. (Acceptable examples include: a utility bill, bank statement, pay stub, government document, or voter registration card.)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

		Thank you in advance for your cooperation. We take election security very seriously.
		In most cases, it's easiest to take these photos with your phone and to then vote with your phone by clicking the ballot link below. A webcam or digital camera can also be used. Images must be high resolution and taken with good lighting so that images are legible.
		If the credentialing team cannot verify your identity from the information you provide, you will be contacted by email for additional documentation.
		If you have any problems voting, you may contact our voter support team by emailing us at support@equal.vote

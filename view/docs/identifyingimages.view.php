		<li>At the time you cast your vote, you will be asked to upload documentation, such as a driver's license, a passport, or an ID card from any state, which we can use to confirm your identity, date of birth, first and last name, address, and voter registration.</li>
		<li>If you believe we may be unable to confirm your identity from your photo ID alone please upload additional documentation, such as a utility bill, bank statement, pay stub, government document, or voter registration card.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		If we are unable to confirm your name, date of birth, and address from your photo ID and the documentation listed above, you can still vote, but your ballot will be considered provisional pending further verification.
	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: bold;">To vote with a provisional ballot please submit the following additional documentation when you cast your ballot:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Any photo ID which includes your date of birth. (This does not need to be government-issued or from Oregon.)</li>
		<li>Another document confirming the address where you are currently registered to vote and your full name as spelled in your voter registration. (Acceptable examples include: a utility bill, bank statement, pay stub, government document, or voter registration card.)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Thank you in advance for your cooperation. We take election security very seriously.
